# cpp-huffman-encoding

In this project, we were required to create a C++ program which would take text from file as an input and then compress it. The compression process that we used is called Huffman Coding. It involves identifying which letters take up the most space (i.e. which letters are repeated the most), and assigning unique codes to each letter. The more repetitive letters/characters end up having smaller codes and hence will take up lesser space than the intial 8 bits that ASCII takes up.
